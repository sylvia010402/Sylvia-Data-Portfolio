# Sylvia Li | Data Portfolio



## About Me


ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Sylvia. Iâ€™m a graduate student in Education Policy Analysis at the Harvard Graduate School of Education. With a background in economics and a growing skill set in data science, Iâ€™m exploring how we can use data not just to describe education systems, but to challenge assumptions, ask sharper questions, and shape better decisions.

I bring a unique perspective to education-focused data analytics in using data to investigate problems I care about: student well-being, equity in school funding, digital learning, and school climate. Each project here represents a new learning curve for me, from deep learning and predictive modeling to scraping enrollment patterns and building policy-relevant dashboards.

This portfolio is a snapshot of what Iâ€™ve built so far. But more importantly, itâ€™s a reflection of how I think, what I value, and how I approach complex questions with empathy and structure. Iâ€™m actively seeking data analyst roles in education research, EdTech, or nonprofit analytics, where I can grow while contributing to meaningful work.

## Portfolio Projects

### 1. [Making Caring Common â€“ Student Bullying Risk Prediction](https://github.com/sylvia010402/student-bullying-prediction)

Using survey data from Harvardâ€™s Making Caring Common initiative, I developed a risk classification system to identify students vulnerable to bullying. Key features included perceptions of safety, belonging, and discrimination, helping educators direct support where itâ€™s needed most.

**Business Impact**: Early-warning system to support student safety and school climate initiatives  
**Dataset**: 8,366 student responses, 195 features  
**Skills**: R, Machine Learning


### 2. [School Funding vs. Socioeconomic Status: What Really Drives Student Achievement?](https://github.com/sylvia010402/school-funding-effectiveness)

This project investigates how per-pupil spending and district-level SES interact to shape academic outcomes. I used multilevel modeling to explore whether spending impacts are more pronounced in lower-SES districts, providing insights relevant for policy advocates and education finance reform.

**Business Impact**: Informs equitable funding formulas and policy debates on school finance  
**Dataset**: SEDA (Stanford), CCD (NCES); 2015â€“2019  
**Skills**: R (lme4, dplyr, ggplot2), data wrangling, multilevel modelling (random intercept)


### 3. [Predicting Success in Online Learning: What Makes Students Complete MOOCs?](https://github.com/sylvia010402/predicting-success-in-online-learning)

I explored what separates students who finish MOOCs from those who drop out by testing six machine learning models. Random Forest performed best, identifying certificate earners with an F1 score of 0.737. This work reflects my interest in understanding learner behavior in online environments.

**Business Impact**: Supports retention and design strategy for online learning platforms  
**Dataset**: HarvardX/MITx anonymized learner data (~100k+ records)  
**Skills**: Python (scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn, xgboost), R, machine learning


### 4. [Tracking Demographics in Somerville Schools: Two Decades of Change](https://github.com/sylvia010402/somerville-school-web-scraping) 

This web scraping and visualization project traces how school demographics shifted in one Massachusetts city known for its school choice policies. Inspired by a case I studied in class, I analyzed patterns in diversity, equity, and parental choice over 20 years.

**Business Impact**: Helps districts evaluate choice policies and equity outcomes  
**Dataset**: Somerville School District enrollment reports (web scraped)  
**Skills**: R (rvest, xml2, tidyverse), data visualizations


### 5. [Facial Emotion Recognition for Mental Health Awareness in Education](https://github.com/sylvia010402/deep-learning-on-facial-emotion-detection)

Using deep learning and facial recognition, this project aims to support educators in understanding studentsâ€™ emotional states in digital classroomsâ€”where non-verbal cues are often lost. By building and evaluating three convolutional models, I explored how real-time emotion detection could power early mental health alerts or responsive teaching tools.

**Business Impact**: Potential to integrate into EdTech platforms to support student well-being and engagement  
**Dataset**: 28Ã—28 pixel grayscale images, ~29,000 samples across 4 emotion classes  
**Skills**: Python (TensorFlow, Keras, Numpy, Pandas), Deep Learning
